/*
 * Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair
 * and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing.
 *
 * Suppose we have an Object that loads data from database.
 * Now we need to modify this data in our program multiple times,
 * so itâ€™s not a good idea to create the Object using new keyword and load all the data again from database.
 * The better approach would be to clone the existing object into a new object and then do the data manipulation.
